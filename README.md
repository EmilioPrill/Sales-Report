**Company Performance Analysis and Reporting**

## Description

This project aims to analyze and report the performance of a company by processing and consolidating data from multiple Excel files. The project involves formatting the data in Excel, joining it in SQL, and performing additional cleaning and transformation using Python. The final output is a comprehensive Power BI report that showcases various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue per team, manager-wise analysis, total revenue, average shipping time, and average revenue per day, among others.

The project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Formatting in Excel**: The initial step involves formatting the data in the provided Excel files. This includes ensuring consistent data structure, cleaning up any inconsistencies or errors, and preparing the data for further processing.

2. **Data Consolidation in SQL**: The formatted data from the Excel files is then imported into a SQL database. The data is joined and transformed using SQL queries to create a unified dataset that incorporates relevant information from all the Excel files.

3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation in Python**: The consolidated data is exported from SQL and further processed using Python. This step involves performing additional data cleaning, transformation, and any necessary calculations or aggregations required for generating the desired KPIs.

4. **Power BI Report Generation**: The processed data is visualized using Power BI to create an interactive and informative report. The report includes various KPIs such as revenue per team, manager-wise analysis, total revenue, average shipping time, and average revenue per day. It provides insights into the company's performance, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.
